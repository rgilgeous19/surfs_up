# SURFS UP CHALLENGE

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

  The purpose of this project is to create a Weather Analysis for the island of Oahu
  so that W.Avy can determine if it is feasible to invest in the Surf n' Shake shop.
  Specifically for this challenge, I found weather data for June and December in Oahu to determine 
  if the business would be sustainable year-round.
  
  
## RESULTS

- June temperatures average 74.94 while December temperatures average 71.04.
- There was a small difference in the maximum temperatures in June and December; the 
  max for those months were 85 and 83, respectively.
- There was a larger difference in the minimum temperatures within June and December. 
  The minimum temperature in June was 64 and the minimum temperature in December was 56.

## SUMMARY
  
  Overall, Oahu seems like the perfect place to open the Surf n' Shake shop. The temperatures
  are ideal througout the year. It is not overly hot, nor overly cold. Another reason why Oahu 
  is the perfect place is because of the amount of rain. The data below shows that there is very little
  rain on this island.

  Two additional queries that I would perform would be:
  
  (1) a query to find out the wind levels throughout the year. We wouldn't want to set up a shop in 
      an area that would be affected by heavy winds. 
      
  (2) a query to find out how many cloudy/sunny days there are during the year. People are more likely to go
      to the beach when it's sunny, so if there are alot of cloudy days, people may assume that rain will fall.
      Unfortunately, that assumption might influence them to stay home, therefore lessening profits for that day.
