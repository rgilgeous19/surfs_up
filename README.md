# SURFS UP CHALLENGE

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

  The purpose of this project is to create a Weather Analysis for the island of Oahu
  so that W.Avy can determine if it is feasible to invest in the Surf n' Shake business.
  Specifically for this challenge, I found weather data for June and December in Oahu to determine 
  if the business would be sustainable year-round.
  
  
## RESULTS

- June temperatures average 74.94 while December temperatures average 71.04.
- There was a small difference in the maximum temperatures in June and December; the 
  max for those months were 85 and 83, respectively.
- There was a larger difference in the minimum temperatures within June and December. 
  The minimum temperature in June was 64 and the minimum temperature in December was 56.
